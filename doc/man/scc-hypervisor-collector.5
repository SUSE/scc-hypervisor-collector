.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]scc-hypervisor-collector\f[R] - SUSE Customer Center hypervisor
collector configuration files.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]scc-hypervisor-collector(1)\f[R] tool depends upon
configuration settings that specify the hypervisors that it needs to
query and the credientials that it will use to upload the collected
details to the SUSE Customer Center.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.PP
By default the \f[B]scc-hypervisor-collector(1)\f[R] will check for
configuration files in the
\f[B]\[ti]/.config/scc-hypervisor-collector\f[R] directory of the
non-root user account that is running the command.
.PP
Only YAML files, with a \f[B].yaml\f[R] or \f[B].yml\f[R] suffix, will
be processed, and sub-directories will not be traversed.
.PP
The \f[B]--config-dir\f[R] option can be used to specify a different
directory, and the \f[B]--config\f[R] option can be used to specify an
explicit config file.
If both options are specified then the specified config file contents
will be merged over any settings loaded from the specfied configuration
directory.
.SH ACCESS AND OWNERSHIP
.PP
For security reasons only the non-root user that is running the
\f[B]scc-hypervisor-collector\f[R] command should be able to access the
specified configuration files.
.SH CONFIGURATION OVERVIEW
.PP
The configuration settings must be specified in YAML format, and must
contain the following top level entries:
.TP
\f[B]credentials\f[R]
A collection of credentials that will be used by the tool.
.TP
\f[B]backends\f[R]
A list of hypervisors that should be queried to obtain the relevant
details.
.SS CREDENTIALS
.PP
The \f[B]credentials\f[R] collection must contain an \f[B]scc\f[R]
entry, which in turn must contain the \f[B]username\f[R] and
\f[B]password\f[R] that will be used to upload the collected details to
the SUSE Customer Center.
.SS BACKENDS
.PP
The \f[B]backends\f[R] entry is a list of collections of the settings
that are needed to successfully connect to the specified hypervisor in
order to retrieve the required details.
.PP
Each entry must contain the following:
.TP
\f[B]id\f[R]
Specifies the logical name that will be used to identify the associated
hypervisor.
.TP
\f[B]module\f[R]
The type of the hypervisor.
Currently one of \[aq]VMWare\[aq], \[aq]Libvirt\[aq].
.PP
The other settings that must be specified are dependent upon the type of
hypervisor being queried, and can be seen by running
\f[B]virtual-host-gatherer --list\f[R].
.SS VMWARE (VCENTER) HYPERVISOR SETTINGS
.PP
The \[aq]VMware\[aq] \f[B]module\f[R] type can be used to retrieve the
relevant details from VMWare vCenter solutions and requires the
following additional settings:
.TP
\f[B]hostname\f[R]
The hostname of the VMWare vCenter to connect to.
Note that if an IP Adress is specified, it must also be included in any
associated TLS Certificate if using a secured connection.
.TP
\f[B]port\f[R] (optional)
The network port to connect to.
Defaults to 443 (HTTPS).
.TP
\f[B]username\f[R]
The username to be used for authentication purposes.
.TP
\f[B]password\f[R]
The password to be used for authentication purposes.
.SS LIBVIRT HYPERVISOR SETTINGS
.PP
The \[aq]Libvirt\[aq] \f[B]module\f[R] type can be used to retrieve the
relevant details from Libvirt (QEMU/KVM) hypervisors and requires the
following settings:
.TP
\f[B]uri\f[R]
Specifies the URI to be used to connect to the target Libvirt
hypervisor.
.TP
\f[B]sasl_username\f[R] (optional)
The SASL Username to be used for SASL authentication.
.TP
\f[B]sasl_password\f[R] (optional)
The SASL Password to be used for SASL authentication.
.PP
Refer to the \f[B]SUSE Virtualization Guide\f[R] -> \f[B]Managing
Virtual Machines with Libvirt\f[R] -> \f[B]Connecting and
Authorizing\f[R] documentation associated with your SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server release for specific details about configuring remote
connection types.
.SS Supported Libvirt URIs
.PP
While \f[B]xen\f[R] connection URIs may work, the primary focus for
development and testing has been on \f[B]qemu\f[R] (QEMU/KVM) Libvirt
hypervisor nodes:
.TP
\f[B]qemu+ssh\f[R]
This connection type requires that you have setup appropriate SSH keys
(\f[B]ssh-keygen(1)\f[R]) that permit passwordless SSH connection to the
target systems, and that the target user account has the required
privileges to be able to query the relevant details using read-only type
requests.
.TP
\f[B]qemu+tls\f[R]
This connection type requires that you have setup x509 client and server
certs appropriately on both the target hypervisor host and the system on
which \f[B]scc-hypervisor-collector\f[R] will be running.
See the Virtualization Guide for your SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
release for more details.
